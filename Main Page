Welcome to the GitHub page for the Cashman Law Firm PLLC website.

The purpose of this project is to get your help with managing articles and errors on the https://www.cashmanlawfirm.com website.

The Cashman Law Firm PLLC website was created in 2010 when we started the law firm. It has gone through many revisions over the years, including template changes, movement from one hosting service to another, implementing free Wordpress.org, then moving to a private paid hosting service using Wordpress.com. With this came Wordpress plug-ins, data management issues, security breaches, and more.

Until now, it was me (https://www.torrentlawyer.com/about-rob-cashman-torrentlawyer/), my small team, and those we hired out on a project-by-project basis to fix problems as they arose. However, other than searching through the website regularly to find errors, I relied on website visitors to let me know when something on the website broke or stopped working.

The purpose of this project is to hopefully organize the website issues that pop up. I will have my team use this to point out errors on the site that they find, and hopefully you (my readers) will do the same.

Obviously the website is a business website meant to bring business to the law firm, but it is also an educational website meant to provide you good and useful content. I am hoping this will be enough of a reason to decide to provide me feedback when something doesn't work.

Other than finding "broken things" (e.g., web forms that don't work, or buttons that don't click), if you have any suggestions for improving the website -- either in the site structure, the navigation (to make it easy to find articles), or in the theme features or layout itself, please let me know.

Warm regards, 
Rob Cashman 
Owner of the Cashman Law Firm, PLLC
